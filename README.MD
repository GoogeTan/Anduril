# Anduril (or And√∫ril)

This is a mod that aims at giving servers the ability to specify guis in resourcepacks so clients can have nice guis instead of ugly chest guis. It also allows for simple custom commands and event handlers to be defined in datapacks. There are also a few other features that many people may enjoy, like dual-wielding attacks!
